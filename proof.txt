Semi-Formal Proof of Minimum Information for Calculating Key Transpositon in Western Music

1. Defining base situation


    a. Written music notation is based on notes located on a staffline

    b. Every note can be represented as (location, degree, frequency) where
            
        location -> ordered set representing location on staff
            location = {C, D, E, F, G, A, B}

        degree -> orderd set representing numerical representation within Western 12-tone scale,
            degree = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1}, each degree is 1 semitone 

        frequency -> ordered set representing frequency in hz of note that we hear. The difference between each pitch is set as 1 (semitone) to keep consistant units with degree. For this excercise the size of the set will equal 12, corresponding to 1 octave
            frequency = {f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7,  f8, f9, f10, f11, }, where the the value of f0 is known as the 'key' of the sheet music 
           
   
         Define FULL: set of 12 notes 

  
    c.  Only 7 out of the 12 members of the set have a coordinate for location. 

    These members are:  

        location of  member l(x): C    D    E     F     G    A      B        
        degree of member d(x):   d0   d2   d4    d5    d7    d9    d12
        frequency of member f(x):f0   f2   f4    f5    f7    f9    f12


       Define V: subset of FULL refered to above, corresponds to notes in the key of C


    d.  V_(location) is used as an alphabet to create strings (in musical terms this "string" refers to consecutive notes on a staff) 
    To represent other members of FULL within a string, one can apply local operators (preoperators) to the locations in V. 
    The operators can be:
   
      <sharp>,   where <sharp>(x) -> 
            d(x) = x+1 and f(x) = x+1

      <flat>, where <flat>(x) ->
            d(x) = x-1 and f(x) = x+1

      <natural>, where <natural>(x) ->
            d(x) and f(x) are the degree and frequency specified in V

************** Define A: above set of local operators or accidentals***************


    Thus a music string consists of a list of locations and operators
 

    e.  In addition, global operators can also be applied to the entire string (aka key signature). Key signatures allows for the creation of set V_keysignature where the scale degrees (di) does not need to be based on the fudemental frequency (f0) in order to directly be represented as a location in the staff (L). 
    
    For example, a set of notes making up the key of G : 
    {(G,d0,f8),  (A, d2, f10), (B, d4, f12), (C,d5, f0), (D, d7, f2),  (E, d9, f4), (F#, d12, f6)} 
    
    can be mapped from V shifting d0 so it corresponds to G and by applying a global sharp to the position of F 
    
    
    
    There are two valid global operations (one with sharps and one with flats) corresponding to every note in FULL 
    
       Global operator are defined:

             op_key(s),  where op /in O, key /in V_location, and s is a string

        ->  op will be applied locally to every element of key in s


    To be a valid global operator, the key is constrained in that 
    if every member of key's degree shifts to its post-operated value,
    the degrees in the set consisting of  op(key) + (V - key)  will still map
    to V via addition or subtraction

    For example:   
            
            If key = {B, E} and op = <flat>, the degree of B and E 
            (defined as B=12 and E=5 in FULL) would now shift to

            B = <flat>B = B-1 = 12-1 = 11
            E = <flat>E = E-1 = 5-1 = 4

            The set Q consisting of key + (V-key) would thus contain the 
            elements {<flat>B, <flat>E } + {C, D, F, G, A}, 
            which corresponds to values of  {10, 4} + {1, 3, 6, 8, 10}

            Ordering the values in N, you get 
                {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11}
            Adding 2 to each value gives you 
                {1+2, 3+2, 4+2, 6+2, 8+2, 10+2, 11+2}

               ={3,   5,   6,   8,   10,  12,   1} = V
                (Remember 13mod12 is 1) 

            Thus since N maps to FULL, <flat>_{B,E} is a valid global 
            operation. (in musical terms, this is the key of B flat and 
            is represented by the Bflat key signature)
            
            
            
    f. Transpositions are a mapping that shift f0 ("key of the sheet music") but retains the relative positions of notes in the string    

    Define:  TRANSPOSITION(f0', string) is a mapping from V to V'  s.t. 
    V = {(d0, f0), (d1, f1)....(d12, f12)} and 
    V'= {(d0, f0'), (d1, f0'+1).....(d12, f0'+2)}
        

2.Proof

    a.  Posit: One could apply TRANSPOSITION(f', string) s.t. 1) the coordinates of L (locations of note on staff) in V are will retain the same relative positions (i.e. staffline positions could shift while pitch differences between adjacent notes remain constant) 2) notes with local operations would retain a local operation, and 3) no new local operations would need to be added 
    
        
    Strategy: 
    b. Given string s on music in the key of k (f0=k) and new key= n (f'=n):

            1. diff = n-k
            2. Move s upwards diff positions on the staff 
                    - this sets condition 1 because relative spacing between note locations is preserved
            3. Apply global operation corresponding with n to the string 
                    - Since the global operation (key signature) associated with a key allows notes in V of that key to sit on the staff without local operations (see 1e), this step ensures condition 3) by mapping all notes previous in V to V_keysignature
                                    
             4. For notes with local operations, apply flats or sharps until the original relative positions are achieved 
                        - Since the key signature mapping detailed in 1e is one-to-one, all notes previously not in V are not in V_keysignature, so they will retain some sort of local operation, ensuring 2) 
             
             
             Since step (3) ensured the relative positions of the non-accidental notes are preserved and step (4) ensured the relative positions of the accidental notes are preserved and [accidentaled notes ] and [non-accidentaled notes] are complementary, all notes have maintained their relative position after f0 shifted to n in step (3)
